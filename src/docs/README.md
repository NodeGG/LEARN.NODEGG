## Introduction

Hello Everyone,

NodeCodes is an Open Source Resource created by Nodegg and Friends to help New and Veteran programmers learn new skills as well as polish old ones. Originally I created this project as a way to give back to the community by writing about topics, concepts, and technologies that I've found useful, or interesting.
